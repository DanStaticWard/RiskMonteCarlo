# Monte Carlo Simulation for the Outcome of Combat in the game of Risk

A simple Monte Carlo script for assessing the outcome of rolls in a game of the board game Risk. My suspicion was the defenders have an advantage in 3 dice versus 2, but it turns out it's attacker advantage.

Realistically, this problem could be solved statistically, and Monte Carlo is completely unnecessary.
